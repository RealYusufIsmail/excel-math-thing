2. **Running the Executable**:
   When you run the downloaded file, you might see a security warning. This is a standard warning for new software. Follow these steps to proceed safely:
   
   - **Windows Defender SmartScreen**: Click on "More info" and then click "Run anyway".
   - **Antivirus Software**: If your antivirus software flags the executable, add it to the whitelist or click "Allow".

3. **Why This Happens**:
   This warning appears because our software is new and has not yet built a reputation with SmartScreen and antivirus services. We are working to establish this reputation as quickly as possible.
